to yourself very loudly. Everyone does it."*

testing plots

```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=5, fig.fullwidth=TRUE}
numpoints <- 4000
xs <- runif(numpoints, -4, 4)
ys <- runif(numpoints, -4, 4)
sets <- rbind(rep(0,numpoints), xs, ys)
sets <- apply(sets, 2, coord_from_edo)
ratios <- apply(sets, 2, ratio)
plot(xs, ys, col=hsv(ratios), pch=20)
```

did that work?
