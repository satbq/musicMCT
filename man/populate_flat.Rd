\title{Randomly generate scales on a flat}
\usage{
populate_flat(
  set,
  target_scale = NULL,
  target_rows = NULL,
  start_zero = TRUE,
  ineqmat = NULL,
  edo = 12,
  rounder = 10,
  magnitude = 2,
  distance = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{set}{Numeric vector of pitch-classes in the set}

\item{target_scale}{A numeric vector which represents a scale
on the target flat.}

\item{target_rows}{An integer vector: each integer specifies a row
of \code{ineqmat} which helps to determine the target flat. The
rows must be linearly independent.}

\item{start_zero}{Boolean: should the result be transposed so that its pitch
initial is zero? Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{ineqmat}{Specifies which hyperplane arrangement to consider. By default (or by,
explicitly entering "mct") it supplies the standard "Modal Color Theory" arrangements
of \code{\link[=getineqmat]{getineqmat()}}, but can be set to "white" or "roth", giving the \code{ineqmat}s of
\code{\link[=make_white_ineqmat]{make_white_ineqmat()}} and \code{\link[=make_roth_ineqmat]{make_roth_ineqmat()}}. For other arrangements, the desired
inequality matrix can be entered directly.}

\item{edo}{Number of unit steps in an octave. Defaults to \code{12}.}

\item{rounder}{Numeric (expected integer), defaults to \code{10}:
number of decimal places to round to when testing for equality.}

\item{magnitude}{Numeric value specifying how many sets to return. Defaults
to \code{2}.}

\item{distance}{How far (in units of voice leading work, using the
Euclidean metric) should the sampled scales be from the input \code{set}?}
}
\value{
A matrix whose columns represent scales on the desired flat.
The matrix has n rows (where n is the number of notes in \code{set}) and
\code{n * 10^magnitude} columns.
}
\description{
Sometimes it's useful to explore a flat or a color by testing
small differences that result from different positions within the
flat. This function generates random points on the desired flat
to test, similar to \code{\link[=surround_set]{surround_set()}} but constrained to lie on
a target flat. Requires a base \code{set} that serves as an "origin"
around which the random scales are to be generated (before being
projected onto the target flat).
}
\details{
The target flat can be specified by naming the \code{target_rows} that
determine the flat (in the manner of \code{\link[=project_onto]{project_onto()}}) or by
naming a \code{target_scale} on the desired flat. Both parameters default
to \code{NULL}, in which case the function populates the flat that \code{set}
itself lies on.

\examples{
# Let's sample several scales on the same flat as j(dia):
major <- c(0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11)
jdia_flat_scales <- populate_flat(major, j(dia))
unique(apply(jdia_flat_scales, 2, whichsvzeroes), MARGIN=2)

# So all the scales do lie on one flat, but they may be different colors.
# Let's plot them using different literal colors to represent the scalar "colors."
jdia_flat_svs <- apply(apply(jdia_flat_scales, 2, signvector), 2, toString)
unique_svs <- sort(unique(jdia_flat_svs))
match_sv <- function(sv) which(unique_svs == sv)
sv_colors <- grDevices::hcl.colors(length(unique_svs), 
                                   palette="Green-Orange")[sapply(jdia_flat_svs, match_sv)]
plot(jdia_flat_scales[2,], jdia_flat_scales[3,], pch=20, col=sv_colors,
  xlab = "Height of scale degree 2", ylab = "Height of scale degree 3",
  asp=1)
abline(0, 2, lty="dashed", lwd=2)
points(j(2), j(3), cex=2, pch="x")
points(2, 4, cex=2, pch="o")

# Most of our sampled sets belong to two colors separated by the dashed
# line on the plot. The dashed line represents the inequality that determines 
# the size of a scale's second step in relation to its first step. This is
# hyperplane #1 in the space, so it corresponds to the first entry in each 
# scale's sign vector. The point labeled "x" represents the just diatonic scale 
# itself, which has a larger first step than second step. The point labeled 
# "o" represents the 12-equal diatonic, whose whole steps are all equal and which 
# therefore lies directly on hyperplane #1. Finally, note that our sampled scales
# also touch on a few other colors at the bottom & left fringes of the scatter plot.
