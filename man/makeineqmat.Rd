\title{Define the hyperplanes for the MCT arrangement of any cardinality}
\usage{
makeineqmat(card)

getineqmat(card)
}
\arguments{
\item{card}{The cardinality of the scale(s) to be studied}
}
\value{
A matrix with \code{card+1} columns and roughly \code{card^(3)/8} rows
}
\description{
As described in Appendix 1.2 of "Modal Color Theory," information about the
defining hyperplane arrangements is stored as a matrix containing the
hyperplanes' normal vectors as rows. (Because these are \strong{mat}rices
and they correspond ultimately to the intervallic \strong{ineq}ualities
that define MCT geometry, this package refers to them as ineqmats, and
sometimes to the individual hyerplanes as ineqs.) These have already been computed and
are stored as data in this package (\code{ineqmats}) for cardinalities up to 53,
but they can be recreated from scratch with \code{makeineqmat}. This might be
useful if for some reason you need to deal with a huge scale and therefore
want to use an arrangement whose matrix isn't already saved. Note that a
call like \code{makeineqmat(60)} may take a dozen or more seconds to run (and
at sizes that large, the arrangement is terribly complex, with ~17K
distinct hyperplanes).

\code{getineqmat} tests whether the matrix already exists for the desired
cardinality. If so, it is retrieved; if not, it is created using \code{makeineqmat}.

\examples{
makeineqmat(2) # Cute: is step 1 > step 2?
makeineqmat(3) # Cute: step 1 > step 2? step 1 > step 3? step 2 > step 3?
makeineqmat(7) # Okay...
ineqmat20 <- makeineqmat(20)
dim(ineqmat20) # Yikes!
