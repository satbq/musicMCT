. The initials MCT in the package title refer to the article's title:
"Modal Color Theory." Offers support for conventional musical pitch
class set theory as developed by Forte (1973, ISBN: 9780300016109) and
David Lewin (1987, ISBN: 9780300034936), as well as for the continuous
geometries of Callender, Quinn, & Tymoczko (2008)
[doi:10.1126/science.1153021](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1153021) .
Identifies structural properties of scales and calculates derived values
(sign vector, color number, brightness ratio, etc.). Creates plots such
as "brightness graphs" which visualize these properties.
