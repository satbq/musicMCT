# Which transpositions give elementary voice leadings?

Just as the transpositions of the diatonic scale can be generated by
Hook's (2008,
[doi:10.1515/9781580467476-008](https://doi.org/10.1515/9781580467476-008)
) elementary "signature transformation," the transpositional voice
leadings of any set can generally be decomposed into a small number of
basic motions. These motions correspond to the arrows in a set's
[`brightnessgraph()`](https://satbq.github.io/musicMCT/reference/brightnessgraph.md).
(The qualifier "generally" is needed because of certain problematic edge
cases, such as the perfectly even scales of
[`edoo()`](https://satbq.github.io/musicMCT/reference/edoo.md) whose
minimal voice leadings always involve entirely parallel motion, which
cannot be derived from "mode shift" voice leadings represented on a
brightness graph.) `vl_generators()` identifies these basic
voice-leading motions.

## Usage

``` r
vl_generators(set, edo = 12, rounder = 10)
```

## Arguments

- set:

  Numeric vector of pitch-classes in the set

- edo:

  Number of unit steps in an octave. Defaults to `12`.

- rounder:

  Numeric (expected integer), defaults to `10`: number of decimal places
  to round to when testing for equality.

## Value

2-by-m matrix whose m columns represent the m distinct voice-leading
generators. The top row indicates the generic size of each interval; the
bottom row indicates the specific size. Results are sorted so that the
first row (generic intervals) is strictly increasing.

## Examples

``` r
diatonic_scale <- c(0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11)
melodic_minor <- c(0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11)
vl_generators(diatonic_scale)
#>                    [,1]
#> generic_intervals     4
#> specific_intervals    7
vl_generators(melodic_minor)
#>                    [,1] [,2]
#> generic_intervals     1    5
#> specific_intervals    2    9
vl_generators(j(dia))
#>                        [,1]    [,2]
#> generic_intervals  2.000000 4.00000
#> specific_intervals 3.863137 7.01955

maj7 <- c(0, 4, 7, 11)
vl_generators(maj7)
#>                    [,1] [,2]
#> generic_intervals     1    2
#> specific_intervals    4    7
```
