makeineqmat() and the quasi-white ineqmat from make_white_ineqmat(). Generally
these are distinct, but they do have some shared hyperplanes in even cardinalities

by offwhite_scales,
offwhite_signvectors,
pastel_scales, and
pastel_signvectors.
This data has not been as thoroughly vetted as the files for the MCT arrangements, and currently
white and pastel arrangements are only represented up through cardinality 6.
The files are hosted at the modalcolortheory repo
like representative_scales because they are too large to include in musicMCT."><meta property="og:description" content="Although the hyperplane arrangements of Modal Color Theory determine most
