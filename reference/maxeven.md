# Maximally even scales

Scales which are "maximally even" divisions of some equal-tempered
universe have several musically interesting properties. When a maximally
even scale has a number of notes (`card`) that is coprime to the size of
the equal-tempered universe, the maximally even scale is called a
"non-degenerate well-formed" or "moment of symmetry" scale. When its
size divides the equal temperament, it is a perfectly even scale. When
it is neither coprime nor a divisor, it produces a scale with a
structure like the octatonic (i.e. a union of perfectly even scales, or
a well-formed scale with a period smaller than the octave). The scale is
generated by quantizing a perfectly even scale to the chosen chromatic
cardinality. Two quantization options are offered (rounding down and
rounding to the nearest value).

## Usage

``` r
maxeven(card, edo = 12, floor = TRUE)
```

## Arguments

- card:

  Number of notes in the scale. Numeric.

- edo:

  Number of unit steps in an octave. Defaults to `12`.

- floor:

  Boolean determining how to quantize. Defaults to `TRUE` causing the
  quantization to round down. If `FALSE` rounds to the nearest value.

## Value

Numeric vector of length `card` representing a scale of `card` notes.

## Examples

``` r
maxeven(7, 12)
#> [1]  0  1  3  5  6  8 10
maxeven(6, 15)
#> [1]  0  2  5  7 10 12
maxeven(6, 15, floor=FALSE)
#> [1]  0  2  4  7  9 12

diatonic_in_19 <- maxeven(7, 19)
tresillo <- maxeven(3,8)
```
