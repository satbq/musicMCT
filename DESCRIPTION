Description: Analysis of musical scales (& modes, grooves, etc.) in the vein of
    Sherrill 2025 <https://collections.lib.utah.edu/ark:/87278/s6d2gr78>.
    The initials MCT in the package title refer to the article's title: "Modal
    Color Theory." Offers support for conventional musical pitch class set
    theory as developed by Forte (1973, ISBN: 9780300016109) and David Lewin
    (1987, ISBN: 9780300034936), as well as for the continuous geometries of
    Callender, Quinn, & Tymoczko (2008) <doi:10.1126/science.1153021>.
    Identifies structural properties of scales and calculates derived values
    (sign vector, color number, brightness ratio, etc.). Creates plots such as
    "brightness graphs" which visualize these properties.
